### Introduction
This article introduces GitHub, a website hosting service that offers a number of features for every software development project, including distributed version control using Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for software development.

### What is GitHub

Most developers, authors, and other professionals utilize Github as their go-to tool or service for organizing and storing their data (codes, texts, manuals). It is a cloud-based service or website that makes it easier for developers to manage, save, and monitor changes to their code.

### Why GitHub

Today, GitHub is more or less a household name in the development community, and even beyond. This is due to a variety of factors, including, among many others, GitHub's user-friendly interface. The fact that GitHub makes it more simpler for individuals and teams to utilize Git for version control and collaboration, however, might be considered to be the most significant factor in responding to the question "why GitHub?"
Without GitHub, utilizing Git often necessitates a little more technical know-how and experience with the command line.
Did I mention that using GitHub's services is completely free? Yes, absolutely free.

### Git VS. GitHub
Let's first look into Git in order to properly explain the distinctions between Git and Github.
Introducing Git, a developer-oriented version control software. Version control describes the method of storing numerous files during the various phases of a project. This practice   is crucial when a software project expands and various contributions are made throughout time. This makes it possible for project contributors to keep an eye on and track each phase of the project's code development lifecycle. The benefit of this is that it makes it easier for contributors to undo any modifications they have made to the original file or files and, if necessary, return to a previous stage.

Git is a distributed version control system that enables individual contributors to push and pull changes to and from installations on other machines. As a result, it promotes collaboration among numerous contributors on a given project. It is crucial to understand that the Git software fails when it comes to contributor collaboration in terms of tracking changes made in real-time. This is due to the fact that it is set up on a user's PC as a standalone software.
On the other hand, GitHub streamlines the use of Git for collaboration.
This explanation is a simple indicator of how different the two are.
Gits version control functions are generally integrated into GitHub, a web-based platform that may be utilized in a collaborative setting.
In order for contributors to collaborate on a single project and track changes in real-time, GitHub users can maintain several code repositories in cloud-based storage. 

### How to Clone repositories on GitHub
Here, we'll look at how to clone repositories using the git clone command, its functionality, and usage before successfully making a copy of an already-existing repository from one directory to another at a different location.

Before we go through each step, it is important to understand what a repository is and how it is created before it can be cloned. This [article](https://www.edureka.co/blog/how-to-use-github/#:~:text=Step%202%3A%20How%20to%20create%20a%20GitHub%20Repository%3F) from Edureka does a good job of explaining how to create a new GitHub repository. 

 After being familiar with the procedures described in the article and being able to successfully build a repository, you may then achieve repository cloning by following the procedures below. 

Git clone is typically used to duplicate or clone an existing repository in a new directory at an alternative location. The original repository could be stored locally on a disk or remotely on a machine that can be accessed via authorized protocols. When a Git repository is cloned using the git clone command, a remote connection named "origin" that points back to the original repository is automatically created. As a result, interacting with a central repository is made very easy.
